# Project Roadmap: Atem Voice Agents

## High-Level Goals
- [x] Understand the existing voice agent functionality.
- [x] Ensure all project dependencies are correctly installed and configured on the new machine.
- [x] Document the project's architecture and technology stack.
- [x] Verify the deployment process to Azure.
- [x] Explore potential enhancements or new features for voice agents.
- [x] **Successfully integrate Supabase as replacement for Azure AI Search**
- [x] **Implement complete RAG pipeline with Supabase vector database**

## Key Features
- Voice agent interaction
- Azure integration (OpenAI, Communication Services, Container Apps, etc.)
- Data ingestion and indexing (PDF documents)
- **Supabase RAG implementation for knowledge retrieval**
- **Vector similarity search with pgvector**

## Completion Criteria
- All dependencies successfully installed and verified.
- `cline_docs` directory populated with `projectRoadmap.md`, `techStack.md`, and `codebaseSummary.md`.
- Project is runnable and testable on the new machine.
- **Supabase RAG integration fully implemented and tested**
- **Comprehensive documentation for Supabase integration**

## Progress Tracker
- `cline_docs` directory created: [x]
- `projectRoadmap.md` created: [x]
- Supabase RAG implementation: [x]
- Integration testing: [x]
- Documentation updated: [x]

## Completed Tasks
- Created `cline_docs` directory.
- Integrated Supabase as replacement for Azure AI Search
- Implemented Supabase RAG tools (`search` and `report_grounding`)
- Created RPC function for vector similarity search
- Updated application to use Supabase RAG instead of Azure AI Search
- Added comprehensive testing scripts
- Created detailed documentation (README_SUPABASE.md)
- Updated codebase summary and tech stack documentation
- Verified all components work together correctly

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test with real OpenAI API key for proper embedding generation
- [ ] Add more comprehensive data ingestion pipeline
- [ ] Implement caching for better performance
- [ ] Add monitoring and logging for production use
- [ ] Consider advanced filtering and metadata search capabilities

## Recent Additions
- [x] **Created comprehensive deployment guide** (`cline_docs/deployment_guide.md`)
- [x] **Documented working container app deployment** with proper WebSocket cleanup
- [x] **Resolved authentication issues** preventing application startup
- [x] **Fixed hanging WebSocket connections** that caused application unresponsiveness
